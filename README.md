## Model

Describe your final model

Report on MAE/MSE/RMSE

Refer to the metrics to describe how well the model would solve the business problem

## Methods
- Remove duplicates, impute, encode, scale.
- 

## Results


## Recommendations:

Use the regression tree, variance has been corrected and good predictive power.


## Limitations & Next Steps
