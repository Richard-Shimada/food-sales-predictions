## Pre-processing
To prepare the dataset for modeling, I removed duplicates, imputed unknown values, encoded categorial data, and scaled numerical data.


## Modeling

Describe your final model

Report on MAE/MSE/RMSE/R2

Refer to the metrics to describe how well the model would solve the business problem



## Results


## Recommendations:

Use the regression tree, variance has been corrected and good predictive power.


## Limitations & Next Steps

Hyper tune regression model or use different model for better fit.
